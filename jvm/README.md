# Example project showing how to use CFG from a Java or Kotlin program

Run `gradle run` in this directory using a recent version of Gradle and Java >= 8.

It should download the required library and its dependencies, and build and run a small program (`src/main/App.kt`) that uses it. The Kotline program also invokes a class written in Java (`src/main/com/reddove/cfgclient/JavaApp.java`) which shows how to access the CFG API from Java.

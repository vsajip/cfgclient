# Example project showing how to use CFG from a Lua program

Run `luarocks install cfg-lib` in this directory using a version of Lua >= 5.3. Then run `lua cfgclient.lua` in this directory.

The first command should download the required dependencies, and the second should run a small program (`cfgclient.dart`) that uses them.

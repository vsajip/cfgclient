# Example project showing how to use CFG from an Elixir program

Ensuring that you have Elixir 1.9.1 or later installed, just do the following steps:

1. `mix deps.get`
2. `mix compile`
3. `mix run cfgclient.exs`

The first step should ensure that the CFG library is downloaded. The second step compiles everything. The last step is the script using the CFG library and it should print "Hello, world!".

# Example project showing how to use CFG from a Dart program

Run `dart pub get` in this directory using a version of Dart >= 2.13.1. Then run `dart run` in this directory.

The first command should download the required dependencies, and the second should run a small program (`cfgclient.dart`) that uses them.
